                <p>
                    Our journey began in 2021 with a bold mission: to share the exhilarating thrill of 
                    whitewater rafting with adventure enthusiasts from every corner of the globe. What started as a small team with a big dream has blossomed into a vibrant organization dedicated to creating unforgettable experiences. Over the years, we have grown into a passionate team of more than 30 skilled professionals, each committed to safety, 
                    exploration, and the joy of outdoor adventures. Today, we proudly organize trips across 20 breathtaking African countries, showcasing the continent's incredible rivers, wildlife, and landscapes, as well as 3 stunning international destinations. With each journey, we aim to inspire a sense of wonder, connection, and respect for the natural world.

                <p>In the early days, our first office was a humble setup in Nairobi, Kenya, where our founders envisioned making adventure accessible to all. 
                    Our CEO, a passionate adventurer and nature lover, led the charge, bringing together a small but ambitious team. Our very first trip was to the wild rapids of the Tana River, where a mix of excitement, teamwork, and a few unexpected splashes created memories that would shape our identity.
                     One of our most unforgettable stories from that trip involves an overly enthusiastic participant who mistook a hippo’s snort for the sound of a distant waterfall! These cherished beginnings remind us of how far we’ve come and continue to fuel our passion for adventure.
